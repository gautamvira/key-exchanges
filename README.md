# Secure communication
C++ code for imitating local and server communications (using text files) by using passwords (hashed) and encryptions techniques.  
C++ code for encrypting and decrypting using a common key (obtained from the Diffie Hellman key exchange program).  
Python codes for performing the Diffie Hellman Key Exchange between two and three users.  

### Instructions
Run the Q1 local file first (default password "anicepass" and add any text to the local text file from the program. Run the Q1 server file next and the text from the local file will get copied to the server data file.  
The public keys can be generated from the python files and also the common key if the public keys of the other users are known, Q2 can then be used using just the common key to perform encryption and decryption.
